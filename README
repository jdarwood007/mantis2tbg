user_table	password		password	Will send a new password to every user
user_table	enabled	tbg3_users	enabled
user_table	protected			Not sure what this is for
user_table	access_level	tbg3_users		Get the MAX(user_table.access_level) to find who is an administrator. I think >= 90 is an admin - TBG admin group is id 1, otherwise set to 2. zegenie: Could also use the "admingroup" (admins) and "defaultgroup" (users) setting from tbg3_settings
user_table	last_visit		lastseen
user_table	date_created		joined

tag_table		Not porting

project_table	description	projects	description

project_version_table	id	builds	id
project_version_table	project_id	builds	project
project_version_table	version	builds		yuck! gonna have to split this over version_major, version_minor and version_revision. Going to need the user to input the format. Use %s and %d as string and decimal places. So, for instance, a normal one would be %d.%d.%d %s (where the %s might be ignored or the "%d %s" becomes the version_revision) - note that all fields are integers AFAIK
project_version_table	released	builds	isreleased
